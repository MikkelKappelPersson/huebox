"""The editor: the frame, under Textual's compositor (migration phases 2–3).

§4.3, §13.7, §14, and `docs/001-spec/textual-migration.md` §5.5. Textual owns
the screen; `render.py` still owns the frame. The rows here are the ones
`draw_editor` wrote, captured rather than re-rendered, so "the frame is
unchanged" is true by construction and I1 measures the compositor underneath
rather than a rewrite beside it.

**The key surface is not reimplemented.** `apply_key` and `EditorState` already
are the whole of huebox's editing behaviour — selection, adjust, undo, revert,
step size, the picker overlay, the save, the two-armed Esc. This module owns
only what a compositor needs to own: getting a key in, redrawing, and taking the
terminal back for the two prompts. So there is one implementation of "what `u`
does" and it is the one the 400-odd existing tests cover.

**Three Textual details this exists to get right.**

*Key names.* Textual says `escape`, `ctrl+c`, `ctrl+s`; `apply_key` was written
against huebox's own reader and says `esc`, `\x03`, `\x13`. `translate` is the
whole of the difference, and it is the only place the two vocabularies meet.

*The prompts.* `apply_key` calls `st.prompt_hex(label)` synchronously, so the
answer has to be available when it returns. `App.suspend()` hands the terminal
back exactly as it was before the app started — cooked mode, no alternate
screen — which is precisely the drop-out-of-raw-mode pattern `edit()` used, and
keeps the seam synchronous instead of turning the whole key surface async.

*Nothing is bound.* Textual's own bindings would swallow keys `apply_key` wants.
`BINDINGS` is empty and every key arrives at `on_key`; the command palette is
off for the same reason.

Not stdout: Textual writes the UI to `sys.__stderr__` on purpose, so a pty
capture sees the frame and nothing else. Diagnostics go to stderr under
`HUEBOX_DEBUG`.
